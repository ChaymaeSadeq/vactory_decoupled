Influence of risk and control functions over the business has been growing, in line with management's expectations. Specifically, the creation of new risk committees, the roll-out of new risk monitoring tools (particularly in credit) and wider system-based controls (notably pre-trade controls and constraints modelling) have shown that business risks are adequately addressed."
