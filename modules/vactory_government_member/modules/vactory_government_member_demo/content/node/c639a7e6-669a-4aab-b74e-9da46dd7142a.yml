Larger managers in Fitch's rated universe, such as Wafa Gestion, tend to have scores of 'Consistent' for Investment Performance, reflecting that the breadth of investment funds or mandates typically corresponds to a breadth of realised investment performance that is closer overall to peer averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leading Moroccan Investment Manager<br />\r\nCreated in 1995 and now the largest asset manager in Morocco (MAD105 billion AUM as at end-September 2018), Wafa Gestion has a long track record and strong domestic presence in all key segments of the market. Distribution relies largely on the banking network of AttijariWafa Bank, and to a lesser extent, Credit du Maroc. Wafa Gestion benefits from the support provided by its main shareholder, AttijariWafa Bank, representing 66% of capital, and from Amundi, which owns the remainder.</p>\r\n"
